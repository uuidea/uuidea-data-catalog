          A Policy MUST have at least one permission, prohibition, or obligation property values of type Rule. (See the Permission, Prohibition, and Obligation sections for more details.)
          A Policy MAY have none, one, or many profile property values (of type IRI [rfc3987]) to identify the ODRL Profile that this Policy conforms to. (See the ODRL Profiles section for more details.)
          A Policy MAY have none, one, or many inheritFrom property values (of type IRI [rfc3987]) to identify the parent Policy from which this child Policy inherits from. (See the ODRL Inheritance section for more details.)
          A Policy MAY have none or one conflict property values (of type ConflictTerm) for Conflict Strategy Preferences indicating how to handle Policy conflicts.(See the Policy Conflict Strategy section for more details.)

      An ODRL Policy MAY also declare properties which are shared and common to all its Rules. Specifically; action properties, sub-properties of relation (such as target), and sub-properties of function (such as assigner and assignee). See section Compact Policy for validation requirements on these shared properties.

      An ODRL Policy must either:

          Only use terms defined in the ODRL Core Vocabulary [odrl-vocab], or
          Use an ODRL Profile that declares the supported vocabulary used by expressions in the Policy.

      In the latter case, the profile property MUST be used to indicate the IRIs of the ODRL Profile(s). See the ODRL Profiles section for more details on mechanisms to define ODRL Profiles and conformance requirements. (The Examples in this document will use ODRL Profile identifiers for illustrative purposes only.)

       An ODRL Policy MAY be subclassed to more precisely describe the context of use of the Policy that MAY include additional constraints that ODRL processors MUST understand. Additional Policy subclasses MAY be documented in the ODRL Common Vocabulary [odrl-vocab] or in ODRL Profiles. A Policy class MUST be disjoint will all Policy subclasses (except for Set).

In some cases, repeat occurrences of some properties are also supported (as described in Policy Rule Composition and Compact Policy) but the normative atomic Policy is consistent with the above property cardinalities.

  PartyCollection:
    description:
      a Party that is a single entity representing a 
      set of member entities. This indicates that all 
      the members of the set will undertake the same 
      functional role in the Rule. 

      For the purpse of the simple_data_catalog, an enumerated list
      representing the IDS-RAM roles is used.

      Data Consumer:
        description:
          The term data user means a natural or legal person who 
          has lawful access to certain personal or non-personal 
          data and has the right, including under Regulation (EU) 
          2016/679 in the case of personal data, to use that data 
          for commercial or non-commercial purposes.
      Data Provider:
        description:
          The term data holder means a legal person, including 
          public sector bodies and international organizations, 
          or a natural person who is not a data subject with 
          respect to the specific data in question, who has 
          the right to grant access to or to share certain 
          personal data or non-personal data in accordance 
          with applicable Union or national law.
      Service Provider:
        description:
          In a data space multiple service providers can offer 
          optional capabilities to enable data sharing and data 
          transactions. Some services may be considered as 
          essential, depending on the data space governance 
          framework. Those may be services required to operate 
          a data space, to intermediate in data transactions, 
          or support the value creation process in a data space. 
          Fundamentally, all such service providers are considered 
          to be a participant in a data space and therefore bound 
          to the agreed policies and rules of a given data space.
