    title: Alliander grid model data
    description: |
      In order to navigate the energy transition, and specifically network congestion, Alliander develops a lot of analysis tools to help them plan and operate the grid more effectiviely. In order to provide these tools with a common source of network data, two teams (one for medium voltage, one for low voltage) publish grid model data conform CGMES, with extensions where neccessary. These datasets are now the source for grid planning, including powerflow simulations and short circuit.

    identifier: uuidea:electricity
    definition: |
      Electricity is the set of physical phenomena associated with the presence and motion of matter possessing an electric charge. Electricity is related to magnetism, both being part of the phenomenon of electromagnetism, as described by Maxwell's equations. Common phenomena are related to electricity, including lightning, static electricity, electric heating, electric discharges and many others. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity)

    identifier: uuidea:interoperability
    definition: |
      “Interoperability refers to the ability of diverse systems, organisations, and individuals to work together seamlessly through shared understanding and mutual compatibility. It is an emergent property that arises from the continuous development and refinement of standards, collaboration among stakeholders, and the dissemination of knowledge across technical, organisational, and societal boundaries.”
